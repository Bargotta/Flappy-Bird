# Flappy Bird
My own version of Flappy Bird! I originally just intended this to be a super simplified version of the game, using this as a learning exercise in [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). However, I've since expanded on this project and am very happy at how this has turned out!
